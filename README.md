This program replicates the game Twenty Four. First, it finds and prints a
range of solutions that's specified by the user. (There is a total of 3,185 solutions.)
Next, this program randomly selects a puzzle for the user to play. The user has to
enter a set of mathematical operators in order to play. The input must be three operators,
and the operators that could be used to play are +, -, /, and *. The program will let the
user know if their input of operators results in 24 or not.
